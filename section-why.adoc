== Why Pivio ?

If you have many services composing your platform it is easy to get lost.
This is especially true for the a microservice environment. While you might want a
great independence of the teams (which do have everything they need under their
  control) reusing services sometimes is advisable. This might be services like
  authentication or a central user service.

A growing number of services means also a challenge not only for developers. Which service
runs where? What does it do? Who is responsible for that?
